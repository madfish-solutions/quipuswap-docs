# What is the difference between FA1.2 and FA2 standards?

Any Tezos user can create a custom token of his own. To facilitate tokenization Tezos employs several token standards:

* **FA 1.2** is the more generic one, supporting only fungible tokens (akin to Ethereum's ERC-20). FA 2 is an advanced standard that also supports NFTs (similar to ERC-721 standard) and allows for multiple tokens to be managed on the same contract (like ERC-1155).
* **FA 2** is an advanced standard that also supports NFTs (similar to ERC-721 standard) and allows for multiple tokens to be managed on the same contract (like ERC-1155). NFT is a non-fungible token (FA2 standard). Each NFT is absolutely unique. This standard is most suited for minting digital collectible items, art objects, tickets, etc.

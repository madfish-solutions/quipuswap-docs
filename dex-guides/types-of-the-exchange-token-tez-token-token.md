# Types of the exchange (Token/TEZ, Token/Token)

QuipuSwap supports two types of liquidity pools: **XTZ-Token** and **Token-Token**.

Previously, a direct token to token swap was not possible and had to be conducted with an extra step (Token-TEZ-Token). Our new Token-Token solution has been extensively tested and audited and is ready for use.

# deposit

An entrypoint that deposits (stakes) tokens. In time of every deposit it claims user's rewards if timelock is finished (only for farms with timelock) or in farms without timelock it just claims user's rewards. In the case of claiming, rewards are minted to the user and to the referrer (_**harvest\_fee**_). Also setups a referrer for a user, votes for a user's baker if the QuipuSwap V1 TOK/TEZ LP token is deposited (staked).

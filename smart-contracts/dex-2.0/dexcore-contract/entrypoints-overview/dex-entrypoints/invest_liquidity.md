### Usage

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note: you need to pass positive TEZ/mutez amount to the _**send()**_** ** method in case of FA1.2/TEZ or FA2/TEZ liquidity investment (see example below).

Also don't forget to add the [DexCore](../../) contract as the operator for your FA2 tokens or make an approve for spending of FA1.2 tokens in time of liquidity investment.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="ðŸŒ® Taquito" %}
```javascript
const dexCoreAddress = "KT1...";
const parmas = {
    pair_id: 0,
    token_a_in: 100,
    token_b_in: 100,
    shares: 100,
    shares_receiver: "tz1.../KT1...",
    candidate: "tz1...",
    deadline: String(Date.parse((await tezos.rpc.getBlockHeader()).timestamp) / 1000 + 100),
};
const dexCore = await tezos.contract.at(dexCoreAddress);
const operation = await dexCore.methodsObject.invest_liquidity(parmas).send({ amount: parmas.token_b_in, mutez: true });

await operation.confirmation();
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

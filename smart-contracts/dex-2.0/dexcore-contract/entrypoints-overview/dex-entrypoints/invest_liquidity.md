### Usage

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note: you need to pass positive TEZ/mutez amount to the _**send()**_** ** method in case of FA1.2/TEZ or FA2/TEZ liquidity investment (see example below).

Also don't forget to add the [DexCore](../../) contract as the operator for your FA2 tokens or make an approve for spending of FA1.2 tokens in time of liquidity investment.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="ðŸŒ® Taquito" %}
```javascript
const dexCoreAddress = "KT1...";
const parmas = {
    pair_id: 0,
    token_a_in: 100,
    token_b_in: 100,
    shares: 100,
    shares_receiver: "tz1.../KT1...",
    candidate: "tz1...",
    deadline: String(Date.parse((await tezos.rpc.getBlockHeader()).timestamp) / 1000 + 100),
};
const dexCore = await tezos.contract.at(dexCoreAddress);
const operation = await dexCore.methodsObject.invest_liquidity(parmas).send({ amount: parmas.token_b_in, mutez: true });

await operation.confirmation();
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Pass `candidate: "tz1ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZNkiRg"`in case of TOK/TOK exchange
{% endhint %}

* `109` - pair doesn't have a liquidity.
* `110` - zero amount of LP tokens (shares) expected.
* `111` - low token A amount in.
* `112` - low token B amount in.
* `136` - reentrancy.
* `141` - wrong amount of TEZ tokens were attached to transaction.

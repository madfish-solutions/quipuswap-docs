# swap

An entrypoint that executes swaps in different liquidity pools (pairs).

All possible routes for swaps are allowed. For example: `FA1.2->TEZ`, `TEZ->FA1.2`, `FA2->TEZ`, `TEZ->FA2`, `FA1.2->FA1.2`, `FA2->FA2`, `FA1.2->FA2`, `FA2->FA1.2`.

Multi token routes are allowed too. For example: `FA1.2->FA2->TEZ->FA2`, `TEZ->FA2->FA1.2->TEZ`, `FA2->TEZ->FA2->TEZ->FA1.2`.

### Usage

{% hint style="danger" %}
You need to pass positive TEZ/mutez amount to the _**send()**_** ** method in case of TEZ->FA1.2 or TEZ -> FA2 swaps (see example below).

Also don't forget to add the [DexCore](../../) contract as the operator for your FA2 tokens or make an approve for spending of FA1.2 tokens in time of FA1.2/FA2->FA1.2/FA2/TEZ swaps.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="ðŸŒ® Taquito" %}
```javascript
const dexCoreAddress = "KT1...";
const parmas = {
    swaps: [
        {
            direction: {
                a_to_b: undefinded,
            },
            pair_id: 1,
        },
        ...
    ],
    deadline: String(Date.parse((await tezos.rpc.getBlockHeader()).timestamp) / 1000 + 100),
    receiver: "tz1.../KT1...",
    referrer: "tz1.../KT1...",
    amount_in: 1000,
    min_amount_out: 998,
};
const dexCore = await tezos.contract.at(dexCoreAddress);
const operation = await dexCore.methodsObject.swap(parmas).send({ amount: parmas.amount_in, mutez: true });

await operation.confirmation();
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Errors

* `108` - pair (pool) with the specified `token_id` not listed.
* `109` - pair doesn't have a liquidity.
* `116` - high expectations of output tokens.
* `117` - empty route of swaps.
* `118` - zero amount in was passed as the parameter.
* `119` - wrong route of a swap.
* `120` - wrong TEZ amount were passed to the transaction.
* `130` - referring on yourself is forbidden.
* `136` - reentrancy.
* `139` - too few swaps.
* `144` - action outdated (the time until which the transaction remained valid was passed).

# launch\_exchange

An entrypoint that launches a new exchanges. Next types of exchanges are supported:

* FA1.2/FA1.2;
* FA1.2/FA2;
* FA1.2/TEZ;
* FA2/FA1.2;
* FA2/FA2;
* FA2/TEZ;
* TEZ/FA1.2;
* TEZ/FA2.

In case of TOK/TEZ exchange launch [voting](../../../bucket-contract/entrypoints-overview/vote.md) in appropriative [Bucket](../../../bucket-contract/) contract is executed. Also all TEZ tokens is [transferred](../../../bucket-contract/entrypoints-overview/fill.md) to the same [Bucket](../../../bucket-contract/) contract before voting.

In time of first exchange launch, this contract calls [_**launch\_callback**_](../callbacks/launch\_callback.md) entrypoint. This is done in order to vote on a [Bucket](../../../bucket-contract/) contract that has just been deployed and cannot be accessed until the launch exchange transaction completes. Therefore, voting takes place in the next transaction, sent from [_**launch\_callback**_](../callbacks/launch\_callback.md).

### Usage

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note: you need to pass positive TEZ/mutez amount to the _**send()**_** ** method in case of FA1.2/TEZ or FA2/TEZ exchanges launch (see example below).

Also don't forget to add the [DexCore](../../) contract as the operator for your FA2 tokens or make an approve for spending of FA1.2 tokens in time of exchange launch.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="ðŸŒ® Taquito" %}
```javascript
const dexCoreAddress = "KT1...";
const parmas = {
    pair: {
        token_a: {
            fa12: "KT1...",
        }, 
        token_b: {
            tez: undefined,
        },
    },
    token_a_in: 100,
    token_b_in: 100,
    shares_receiver: "tz1.../KT1...",
    candidate: "tz1...",
    deadline: String(Date.parse((await tezos.rpc.getBlockHeader()).timestamp) / 1000 + 100),
};
const dexCore = await tezos.contract.at(dexCoreAddress);
const operation = await dexCore.methodsObject.launch_exchange(parmas).send({ amount: parmas.token_b_in, mutez: true });

await operation.confirmation();
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Errors

* `104` - wrong order of a tokens from parameters.
* `105` - zero token A amount in.
* `106` - zero token B amount in.
* `107` - pair (pool) with the specified `token_id` already listed.
* `120` - wrong TEZ amount were passed to the transaction.
* `136` - reentrancy.
* `144` - action outdated (the time until which the transaction remained valid was passed).

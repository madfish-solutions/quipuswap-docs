# set\_admin

Changing of the contract administrator is done in 2 steps:

1. Current administrator should transfer his rights to a new administrator.
2. A new administrator must accept his new role. If he didn't accept a new role, the previous administrator continues to be an administrator of this contract.

This entrypoint describes the first step of changing the contract administrator. The second step is described [here](confirm\_admin.md).

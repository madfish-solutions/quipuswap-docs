# Fees overview

Fees have 16 decimals (the precision for fees calculation). When the admin setups fee, he should add 16 extra symbols (multiply by 10^16). For example:

* 15% must be 15 \* 10^16;
* 21.5% must be 21.5 \* 10^16;
* 19.99% must be 19.99 \* 10^16;
* 1% must be 1 \* 10^16;
* 100% must be 100 \* 10^16.

### Divest imbalance vs divest one

If you try to divest in imbalanced method you should pass **required** amount(-s) of output token(-s) and **maximum** of LP token (shares) to be burnt.

When you try to divest in one coin you should pass amount of shares to be burnt and **minimal amount** of token that you want to receive.

{% hint style="danger" %}
All of sent shares would be burnt when divest in one coin. Even if shares value greater than avaliable reserves of token.
{% endhint %}

In each way you would pay some fees to pool for imbalanced divest.

If you divest in balanced way, you wouldnâ€™t pay any fees.

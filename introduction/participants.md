# Participants

The QuipuSwap community is composed of five primary user roles: liquidity providers, traders, bakers, voters, and developers.&#x20;

**Liquidity providers** create liquidity pools and provide them with Tez and the corresponding FA1.2 and FA2 tokens.&#x20;

**Traders** earn trading fees and may participate in our liquidity mining programs. Traders exchange one token for another.&#x20;

**Bakers** manage individual pool’s assets when it comes to baking in Tez/token pools and encourage liquidity providers to vote for them by, for example, offering them better rewards.&#x20;

**Voters** stake their shares to vote for their chosen baker (that they feel is contributing to a system’s wellbeing and maximizing the baking rewards) or against a malicious one. Voting only happens in Tez/token pools.&#x20;

**Developers** build solutions to directly integrate QuipuSwap smart contracts to power new and exciting interactions with tokens, trading interfaces, retail experiences, etc.&#x20;

This list is not exhaustive. As the protocol develops, more roles such as **governor** or **liquidity** miner might be introduced.&#x20;

In general, interactions between the roles create a positive feedback loop, allowing for new economic opportunities in the Tezos ecosystem and paving the way to more complex solutions.

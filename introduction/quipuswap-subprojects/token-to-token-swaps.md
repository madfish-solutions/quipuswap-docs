# Token to Token Swaps

Previously QuipuSwap used the formula TOKEN A→TEZ→TOKEN B to exchange one Tezos-based token for another. QuipuSwap Token2Token protocol grants access to token-to-token pools in which anyone can create and add liquidity.

This solution reduces the costs for token-to-token transactions. Additionally, token-to-token pool creation is manyfold cheaper.&#x20;

# QuipuSwap Farms

Smart contracts for QuipuSwap farms are built, internally audited, and then ready to go. We still need time for UI integration and Mainnet deployment, however. Interface fees are supported, incentivizing other platforms to integrate farms into their interface.

There are two options for farming contracts:&#x20;

* Staking LPs or single assets to earn QUIPU.&#x20;
* Staking LPs or single assets to earn other tokens.\

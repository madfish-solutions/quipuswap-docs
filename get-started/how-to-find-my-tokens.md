# How to find my tokens

If you know that you were sent any amount of a certain token but it is not shown in your wallet, there are several ways to go about it.

1. Find the token contract address and add it manually to the wallet. For instance, in the Temple wallet, you need to use the Manage section and click the “Add Token” button. [Read a detailed guide here](https://youtu.be/GoJPvlrHvQE).
2. If you do not know the contract address of the token, you can visit the [blockchain explorer](https://tzkt.io) page, paste your account address and see all assets owned by this account under the Tokens tab.
